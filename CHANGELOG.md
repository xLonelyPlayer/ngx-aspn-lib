### New theming library

Added theming library, including many bootstrap-like css utilities. This is only possible to the awesome [Net Ninja SASS Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9jxJX7vojNVK-o8ubDZEcNb). I've learned so much with this tutorial and I'm currently using many of his [tutorial repository](https://github.com/iamshaunjp/complete-sass-tutorial).

I have further added 5 themes as default themes to be used. Checkout `projects/theming/README.md` for more information.
